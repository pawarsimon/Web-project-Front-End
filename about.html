                <h2>About Waltham Watches</h2>
                <p>The Waltham Watch Company, also known as the American Watch Company, made over 40 million watches, clocks and other precision implements between the years of 1850 and 1957. The watches are highly collectible and people often want to know Waltham watches values. The value of any watch takes into account the condition of the watch, demand for the watch and how many are available for purchase.</p>
                <p>Condition - This is one of the most important factors in determining the value of a watch. A watch in poor condition is likely to be of less value than a watch in good condition. Most watches are more valuable if they are in their original state and have not had parts replaced or repaired.<br><br>
                Materials - Watches that are made from precious metals or set with diamonds will have an inherent scrap value. A watch, for instance that is made from platinum will always be valuable for the value of the scrap platinum alone. This is worth considering when looking at the value of damaged or broken watches.<br><br>
                Rarity - As a rule, the rarer a watch the higher the value. This applies to Waltham watches as well as watches by other manufacturers.<br><br>
                Economy - The general economy can have an effect on the value of watches. In good times, when people have more spare cash and are prepared to invest in collectibles more, this can lead to higher prices. When the economy is performing less well, collectors often sell some of their collection and people have less money to spend and this can push the value of watches down.
